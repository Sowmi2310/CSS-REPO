    <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px;font-weight: 400px;font-family: cursive;">Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups.

        "Psychological peace" (such as peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined, yet often a necessary precursor to establishing "behavioural peace". Peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a "peaceful inner disposition". Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with certain inner qualities—such as tranquility, forbearance, respect for others, compassion, self-control, courage, moderation, forgiveness, good temper, caution, and perspective—that do not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life.[citation needed] The acquisition of such a peaceful internal disposition for oneself and others can contribute to resolving otherwise seemingly irreconcilable conflicts.</p>
